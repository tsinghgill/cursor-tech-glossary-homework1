   When I run this on selected HTML (cards, headers, or sections): 
   Improve typography and spacing so it's easy to scan in an executive review. 
   Make key labels (like status, owner, or titles) visually distinct and scannable. 
   Maintain accessible color contrast and readable font sizes. 
   Keep the underlying data and wording exactly the same; only change structure and presentation. 
   Prefer small, focused improvements over full layout rewrites.
